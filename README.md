# CustomAccessPoint

Android app for a better managment of your mobile hotspot

## Goals
The goal of this project was to create a small android app in order to monitor devices connected to your Android access point.
You can also save the known users with a level of authorisation.

## Ideas for the future
- Root your android device for a better managment and maybe reset credentials
- Deauthentication attack on forbidden users
- Send alerts when a new connection is detected
